# Roller Coaster Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a roller coaster dataset. The EDA was performed using industry-standard Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Contents
- `coaster_db.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for EDA.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Steps Taken

### Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Null values were handled appropriately.
- **Column Renaming**: Columns were renamed for clarity and consistency.
- **Column Dropping**: Unnecessary columns were dropped to streamline the analysis.

### Feature Understanding
- **Bar Charts**: Utilized to understand the distribution of categorical features.

### Feature Relationships
- **Scatter Plots**: Investigated relationships between numerical features.
- **Pair Plots**: Visualized pairwise relationships across multiple features.

### Data Querying
- **Pandas Queries**: Utilized Pandas querying functionality to extract specific insights from the dataset.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
